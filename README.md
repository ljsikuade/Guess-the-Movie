# Guess-the-Movie
Having used socket.io in some previous projects (but only to a limited extent), I wanted to play around with the technology some more
and experiment. 

# The User Journey
1. User joins a room.

2. Once more than two people have joined. User may select 'ready'.

3. Once four players are ready, the game auto-starts. No more than four players are allowed in a room.

4. Five rounds are played (but this can be any number). Fifteen seconds elapse per round.
A user cannot enter more than one answer per round.
